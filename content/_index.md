          I love the editing you do on our show. You cut out the pieces when I’m looking stuff out on the web, and put in delightful little clips.

          Chris is everything we could ask for in an audio producer for our podcast. He is reliable, flexible, and creative. And of course, he makes us sound good!

          The reason we’re able to keep doing ShopTalk week after week is because we have Chris Enns behind the scenes stitching together our tracks, fixing our flubs, equalizing the sound, and adding a little flair where the episode could use it. He makes it all work, while bringing new ideas and enthusiasm to the process.
